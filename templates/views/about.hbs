      <p class="about-me">
        I am Assistant Software Developer at <a href="https://giix.ai/">Global information interchnage Xchange</a>. I have worked in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering">Mechanical Engineering</a> field for almost 2
        years
        as
        Service Engineer at <a href="https://koel.kirloskar.com/">Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited (KOEL)</a> since I have done my graduation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Technology">Bachelor of Technology</a> in <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering">Mechanical Engineering</a>
        from <a href="https://www.lpu.in/">Lovely Professional University</a>, Punjab. I am currently working as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer">Web Developer</a> to learn more about coding in different languages so that I
        can
        use
        them in my upcoming project which requires knowledge of
        both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering">Mechanical Engineering</a> and

        <h3 class="skill-heading">HTML</h3>
        <p class="about-skill">
          HTML is one of my favourite language. I had started working on HTML when I was in High School. I had always interest in computer when I was kid. And for kid who didn't have knowledge of how any website worked during early time, it was a
          big
          thing to make his own page even it was just a single page. That is how I started working on HTML and got my interest in this.

        <h3 class="skill-heading">Parametric Creo</h3>
        <p class="about-skill">
          This is the second best thing that I have learnt. Creo is basically a 3D/2D designing software. It allows user to create anyhthing in 3D Model even assemble different 3D models to make a single working unit. For example, we can create
          different engine parts small like bolts to big like flywheels and gears. Then we can assemble all parts to make a working engine in this software. We can see animation of working engine and even can do analysis on it to check effect of
          different mechancial load parameters on our model. So, it is very useful tool for any Design Engineer.
